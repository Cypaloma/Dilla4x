# Dilla4x - Open Musical Instrument Platform

**An open musical instrument platform dedicated to J Dilla (James Dewitt Yancey)**
*Currently in closed collaborative development phase for participant privacy*

## 📖 Project Overview
Dilla4x is a minimalist 4x4 ortholinear MIDI controller inspired by classic MPC layouts. This repository contains:
- Hardware designs
- Firmware source code
- Comprehensive documentation/wiki (recently reorganized)
- Course materials for collaborative learning

**Important Note:** This project is currently in an early development phase as part of a closed course where participants collaboratively develop instruments and contribute to the repository. The materials will be fully open-sourced after the course completion.
