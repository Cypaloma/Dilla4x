# COGNITIVE TRAPS

Use when GREEN/YELLOW but thinking is blocking access to the Tech-Toolbelt.  
If RED or spiraling: Page 1.

**How to use:** Find the loop sentence → match a row → answer the question in one concrete sentence → then Page 2 (one test).  
**One-line rule:** Care first. Then one controlled test.

| # | Distortion (example loop sentence) | Counter-move question (answer once, then run one test) |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **ALL-OR-NOTHING** — "If it's not perfect, it's pointless." | What's the smallest useful outcome for this session? |
| 2 | **CATASTROPHIZING** — "This error means everything is broken." | What is the concrete impact right now (today), not the whole chain? |
| 3 | **OVERGENERALIZING** — "I'm awful with tech. I always mess this up." | Which exact step is failing, under what conditions? |
| 4 | **LABELING** — "I'm stupid / broken / useless." | Describe the situation without mentioning yourself: what is hard, and why? |
| 5 | **SHOULD STATEMENTS** — "I should already know this." | Drop "should." According to who? Who benefits from that rule? |
| 6 | **MIND READING** — "People will judge me / I'll look incompetent." | Assume you can't know. What action helps you either way? |
| 7 | **FORTUNE TELLING** — "This will never work." | What one small, reversible test would count as evidence either way? |
| 8 | **PERSONALIZATION** — "This broke because of me." | What changed last? What single test targets that change? |
| 9 | **MENTAL FILTER** — "Nothing works. Everything is failing." | What is one neutral fact you can verify right now? |
| 10 | **EMOTIONAL REASONING** — "I feel doomed, so it's doomed." | The feeling is real. What are the facts in one sentence? |

## IF THIS PAGE ISN'T HELPING
If you can't match a row, can't answer the question, or you're getting more activated:  
Go to Page 1 → YELLOW track or Stop Rules. If you stop, stop. When you return later: start again at Page 1.
