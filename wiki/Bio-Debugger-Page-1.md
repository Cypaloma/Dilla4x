Access-First Protocol for Technical Overwhelm • Educational (not medical advice) • Use what helps; skip what doesn't

## 1) STATE CHECK
- **GREEN (1):** I can think clearly. I'm learning.
- **YELLOW (2):** I'm strained; I can continue only if I simplify.
- **RED (3):** I'm flooded (panic/anger/shutdown/tears/urge to quit)

## 2) RED TRACK — 90-SECOND RESET
**A. STOP (20 sec)**  
Stop → Step back → Observe (body + urge) → Proceed with one deliberate action.

**B. EXHALE RESET (45 sec)**  
Inhale 2–3 sec → Exhale 6–8 sec × 5 rounds.

**C. ORIENT (30 sec)**  
Name 5 things you see → feel feet/hands → turn your head slowly and re-locate yourself in the room.

**If you're still RED after 2 rounds: STOP RULES (Block 5). Do not continue.**

## 3) YELLOW TRACK — REDUCE LOAD
- [ ] Close extra tabs/windows (leave only what you're using).
- [ ] Turn off notifications / mute chat for 10 minutes.
- [ ] Reduce sensory intensity (brightness/audio).
- [ ] Write the goal in one sentence: "I am trying to ____."
- [ ] Make the next step "tiny" (Block 4).
- [ ] Set a timer: 5 minutes (then reassess state).

## 4) NEXT TINY STEP
- [ ] Reproduce once (same steps, observe exactly what happens and collect info/errors).
- [ ] Single-variable change (research and change ONE thing → test once).
- [ ] Return to known-good (revert preset/file/version/settings).

## 5) STOP RULES
Stop and switch strategies if any are true:
- [ ] I've made 3 changes without understanding cause/effect.
- [ ] I'm repeating the same steps and learning nothing new.
- [ ] My body alarm is high (shaking, nausea, tunnel vision, shutdown).
- [ ] I'm arguing with myself / self-attacking / "I'm broken" thoughts.

Switch to (choose ONE):
- [ ] 5-minute break + water + return to Block 1
- [ ] Park it: write "next step" and stop for today

**Stopping is a skill. Pausing protects future progress.**
