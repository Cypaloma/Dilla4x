# TECH-TOOLBELT

**This page only works with Page 1.**  
Use Page 1 to check your state and take care of yourself first. Then use this toolbelt for technical steps.  
If you're RED or looping: return to Page 1 before doing more troubleshooting.

## TOOL 1 — ONE-CHANGE TROUBLESHOOTING
**Rule:** One change → one test → one conclusion.

1) **Pick ONE area (examples):**  
Physical (cable/port/power/device) • Computer (space/permissions/I-O selection) • App (one setting/toggle) • File/Data (different file/preset/smaller test) • Network/Service (only if relevant) • …etc.

2) **Pick ONE change:**  
Swap cable/port • restart one thing (app or device) • flip one setting • try a known-working file/preset/setup • simplify for one test (fewer devices/apps) • side-by-side compare (same steps, one difference)

3) **Call the result:**  
Better / Worse / Same / Unclear  
If Unclear → simplify the test (fewer steps, fewer moving parts) and try again with one change.

**Hard rule:** if you can't say what changed in one sentence, you changed too much.

## TOOL 2 — KNOWN-GOOD SNAPBACK
**Purpose:** get back to stable so you can move forward again.

Choose the smallest reset that fits where you are:
- Undo the last small change
- Switch to something you already know worked (file/preset/setup)
- Reset one setting to a neutral/default value (just for a test)
- If you're deep in the weeds: starting fresh (new project / clean setup) can be the fastest path back to clarity

Stop as soon as it works again.

## TOOL 3 — MICRO-RECORD (optional, minimal)
**Purpose:** keep notes tiny while preventing loops. Use only if it helps.

Record only:
- The small change (one sentence)
- The result/output (error text, or Better/Worse/Same/Unclear)

That's it.
