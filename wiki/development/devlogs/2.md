Assembly is even slower than I had anticipated despite recognizing my estimates of workload were way off. 

Obvious, glaring problems to be solved in future attempts at the closed course structure we've attempted:
1. A research and development phase needs to be done PRIOR to the recruitment of the participants. 
2. dupont wires are not the move. Either expensive solid core duponts or wires with clips. 
3. Realistically what this needed was a custom PCB that joined all of the grounds to common, to be a larger instrument that cound house a breadboard, or a purely DIY focused cousrse. 

Upon starting, this course was designed to have its participants build their own instruments from Arduinos, with their specifications customized per user. It was a closed course, with a set of instructions and a set of materials, and those materials proved problematic, as outlined in the previous log.

Administratively, this course took far longer than I had anticipated to begin, and as such, we had to pivot from the original idea and instead ship out prebuilt kits. THIS was where everything went wrong, in combination with the extra assembly steps our sub-par materials required.
