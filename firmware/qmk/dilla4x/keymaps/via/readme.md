# VIA Keymap

VIA-enabled keymap for real-time configuration via the VIA web interface.

## Features

- **Runtime Configuration**: Remap any key using [VIA Configurator](https://usevia.app/)
- **Single Layer**: Starts with only MIDI notes on Layer 0
- **Dynamic Layers**: Add additional layers via VIA as needed (VIA v3 supports unlimited layers)
- **Persistent Storage**: Changes saved to EEPROM

## Default Layout

Same as the default keymap - chromatic MIDI notes C2 to D#3.

## VIA Setup

1. Flash this keymap to your device
2. See [VIA_SETUP.md](VIA_SETUP.md) for complete VIA configuration instructions
3. Open https://usevia.app/ to customize

## Note

VIA requires submitting a keyboard definition to the-via/keyboards repository. Until approved, use the Design tab in VIA to load the definition manually.
